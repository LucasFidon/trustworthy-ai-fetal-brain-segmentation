# A Dempster-Shafer approach to trustworthy AI with application to fetal brain MRI segmentation


## System Requirements
#### Hardware requirements
To run the automatic segmentation algorithms a NVIDIA GPU with at least 8GB of memory is required.

The code has been tested with the configuration:
* 12 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz
* 1 NVIDIA GPU GeForce GTX 1070 with 8GB of memory

#### OS Requirements
The code is supported on every OS using docker.
However, it has been tested only for
* Linux Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
* Linux Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
